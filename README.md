# JavaScript fundamentals coding quiz

**Version 1.0.0**

Created a quiz that tests the user on JavaScript fundamentals. When the start button is clicked, user is presented with a question and a timer starts. If a question is answered incorrectly, time is subtracted from the clock. When all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, the game is over.
